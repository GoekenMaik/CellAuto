# Requirements and installation
Please make sure the header files of the SDL2-Library are installed on your machine. Compile the program by typing ```make```. Uses gcc for compilation.  
Afterwards start the program by typing ```./CellAuto```  
The program will then ask you for input of an integer of a rule. It allows input from 0-255.
Alternatively you can provide the rule as an argument with the program call: ```./CellAuto 30```
